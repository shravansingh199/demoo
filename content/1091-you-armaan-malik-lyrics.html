<p>All My Friends<br />
Talk About The Night We Met<br />
Can&#8217;t Remember What I Said<br />
But I Bet It Wasn&#8217;t Cool</p>
<p>I Was Close To Death<br />
With You In That Perfect Dress<br />
Knowing That It&#8217;s Heart Or Head<br />
And Breaking All The Rules</p>
<p>Just Like Don&#8217;t Fall In Love<br />
Before I Know Your Name<br />
Holding Out Hoping<br />
That You Feel The Same</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;ve Never Been<br />
One For Sounding Cliche<br />
But It&#8217;s True</p>
<p>All I Do Is Think About You &#8211;(2)</p>
<p>All I Do Is Think About How<br />
Your Leap Of Faith Made Me<br />
Put All My Faith In You</p>
<p>So, All I Do Is Think About</p>
<p>No Regrets<br />
Not Even The Nights We Spent<br />
Finding Out What Patience Meant<br />
Holding Up A Mirror To Myself<br />
Learning To Reflect Because</p>
<p>Love Like This Doesn&#8217;t<br />
Come Round All The Time<br />
And Letting You Get Away<br />
Would Be A Crime</p>
<p>Cause Half Of Your Heart<br />
Makes A Whole Out Of This<br />
Heart Of Mine</p>
<p>All I Do Is Think About You &#8211;(2)</p>
<p>All I Do Is Think About How<br />
Your Leap Of Faith Made Me<br />
Put All My Faith In You</p>
<p>So, All I Do Is Think About You<br />
All I Do Is Think About You</p>
<p>All I Do Is Think About<br />
How Long I Can Wait<br />
Until I Get To Say &#8220;I Do&#8221;</p>
<p>So, All I Do Is Think About How<br />
All My Friends<br />
Talk About The Night We Met<br />
Can&#8217;t Remember What I Said</p>
<p>But It Worked Out Beautiful</p>
<p>All I Do Is Think About You &#8211;(2)</p>
<p>All I Do Is Think About How<br />
Your Leap Of Faith Made Me<br />
Put All My Faith In You</p>
<p>So, All I Do Is Think About You<br />
All I Do Is Think About You</p>
<p>All I Do Is Think About<br />
How Long I Can Wait<br />
Until I Get To Say &#8220;I Do&#8221;</p>
<p>So, All I Do Is Think About You</p>
