<p>Now I Know</p>
<p>I Made A Mistake</p>
<p>I Shouldn&#8217;t Have Let You Go</p>
<p>I Should Have Stuck To Held Your Heart</p>
<p>And I Should Have Let You Know</p>
<p>I Keep On Running Thinking All The Day<br />
About Us Vibing Older Memories</p>
<p>Now I Know</p>
<p>I Made A Mistake</p>
<p>I Shouldn&#8217;t Have Let You Go</p>
<p>I Would Do Anything To Have You In My Arms</p>
<p>In My Arms, Once Again</p>
