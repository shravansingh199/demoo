<p>Guess, I&#8217;m Under Your Control<br />
I Can&#8217;t Take It Any, Any More</p>
<p>How You Gonna Play Me Like That?<br />
Why You Gonna Make It Complicated?<br />
You Won&#8217;t Even Text Me Back<br />
You Know The Ways To Keep Me Waiting</p>
<p>Say, I&#8217;m Done Till You<br />
Tell Me Come Over<br />
I Can&#8217;t Help Myself</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m Under Your Control<br />
And I Can&#8217;t Take It Any More<br />
We Should Make This Personal<br />
Why Can&#8217;t You Just Close The Door?</p>
<p>Do You Want It?<br />
Do You Want It Like That? <em>like that</em><br />
Keep On Pushing And You Pulling Me Back<br />
Guess, I&#8217;m Under Your Control<br />
I Can&#8217;t Take It Any, <em>Any More</em></p>
<p>Control, <em>Any More</em> &#8211;(2)</p>
<p>Try To Look For Someone Else<br />
But Nothing I Do Can Keep Me From You<br />
I&#8217;ve Been Lying To Myself<br />
And I Know You&#8217;re Lying, That Makes Two</p>
<p>Say, I&#8217;m Done Till You<br />
Tell Me Come Over<br />
I Can&#8217;t Help Myself</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m Under Your Control<br />
And I Can&#8217;t Take It Any More<br />
We Should Make This Personal<br />
Why Can&#8217;t You Just Close The Door?</p>
<p>Do You Want It?<br />
Do You Want It Like That? <em>like that</em><br />
Keep On Pushing And You Pulling Me Back<br />
Guess, I&#8217;m Under Your Control<br />
I Can&#8217;t Take It Any, <em>Any More</em></p>
<p>Control, <em>Any More</em> &#8211;(2)</p>
<p><em>I Can&#8217;t Take It Any More, I Can&#8217;t Take It</em></p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m Under Your Control<br />
And I Can&#8217;t Take It Any More<br />
We Should Make This Personal<br />
